# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the Student Marketplace Hub application (backend and frontend) to the Internet Computer mainnet so it is publicly accessible.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the backend Motoko canister to the IC mainnet
- Deploy the frontend to the IC mainnet with a public URL
- Verify Internet Identity authentication works on the live deployment
- Confirm all existing features are functional on the live deployment (marketplace listings, service listings, papers upload, video sharing, admin dashboard, user profiles, meetup tracker)

**User-visible outcome:** The Student Marketplace Hub is live on the Internet Computer mainnet and accessible to anyone via a public IC URL, with all existing features and authentication working.
